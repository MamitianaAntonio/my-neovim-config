# Antonio.nvim

> A personal Neovim configuration built for performance, clarity, and continuous learning.

---

## 📖 Overview

Antonio.nvim is my custom Neovim setup, originally inspired by kickstart.nvim and progressively redesigned to match my workflow.

This is not a Neovim distribution.

It is a learning-focused, developer-driven configuration where every plugin and setting is intentionally chosen and manually configured.

The goal is simple:

- ⚡ Fast startup
- 🧠 Modern development features
- 🎯 Clean and minimal interface
- 🔬 Full understanding of the system

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

I build my own configuration to:

- Understand how Neovim works internally
- Learn Lua through real-world usage
- Control performance and plugin behavior
- Avoid “black box” configurations
- Improve long-term maintainability

This repository reflects my growth as a developer.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 Plugin management with **lazy.nvim**
- 🔎 Fuzzy finding with Telescope
- 🌳 File navigation with Neo-tree
- 🧠 LSP support for modern languages
- ⚡ Autocompletion and snippets
- 🔧 Git integration
- 🎨 UI improvements and custom styling
- ⌨️ Custom keymaps optimized for workflow

Every plugin is added with purpose.
